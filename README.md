# What?

Pushy is an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) package for Python and Java. The key feature of Pushy is that it only requires
Python and an SSH daemon on the "server". You don't need to install anything on the remote machine, which makes Pushy
useful for controlling remote systems without installing custom software on them.

The core of Pushy is written in and for Python, and a Java API is provided that sits on top of this. The Java API allows
developers to write Java code that interacts local or remote Python (plain old CPython, not Jython) interpreters,
providing Java abstractions around Python modules, that will be more familiar to Java developers.

# How?

First, install Pushy by one of several methods:

* Using [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org): `pip install pushy`
* Grab the source archive from [the PyPI page](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pushy/), and run the usual:
  `python setup.py install`
* *Java users only:* Grab the jar file for Java and add it to your classpath. It's self-contained (Java and Python code
  together.)

### Python Example

Now you're ready to create a Pushy connection. In the example below, we create a connection to a remote machine and
list the directories in the home directory of the user 'me'. In accessing an attribute of a connection's "modules",
you are effectively "importing" the remote module of that name. A proxy to that module is returned, and from then on
you can (more or less) treat the module as if it were locally defined.

```python
import pushy
    
with pushy.connect("ssh:remotehost", username="me", password="password") as conn:
    for (root,dirs,files) in conn.modules.os.walk("."):
        for d in dirs:
            print conn.modules.os.path.join(root, d)
        for f in files:
            print conn.modules.os.path.join(root, f)
```

### Java Example

To do this from a Java program, you write code very similar to how you would if you were writing it for the local
machine. The Pushy Java API provides a means of interrogating the remote system's properties, using a similar API to
`java.lang.System`. This can be used to obtain the current working directory; with that in hand, `pushy.io.File` can be
used in a similar way as `java.io.File` to list files.

```java
import pushy.io.File;
import java.util.Properties;

public class ListFiles {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.setProperty("username", "me");
        props.setProperty("password", "password");
        pushy.Client client = new pushy.Client("ssh:remotehost", props);
        try {
            pushy.RemoteSystem system = client.getSystem();
            String cwd = system.getProperty("user.dir");
            java.io.File dir = new pushy.io.File(client, cwd);
            for (java.io.File file : dir.listFiles()) {
                System.out.println(file);
            }
        } finally {
            client.close();
        }
    }
}
```
